This is my College Thesis Project. Itâ€™s a website for nutritionists and personal trainers to register their clients. Professionals can add new diets, training plans, and measurements. Based on the registered data, they can view a chart showing their clients' progress. Clients also have separate access to view their training plans and diets.
